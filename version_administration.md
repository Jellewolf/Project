Code administration
-------------------

Rules
-------------------
Code
All code/classes/comments need to be written in English
For code and classes no capitalisation
-------------------
Variables
For variables if more then 1 word use camel, example: camel = $inlogPagina
If only 1 word do not use any capitalisation.
-------------------
Database
Database tables/collums should all be in english.
For database tables and collum names we dont use any capitalisation.
We only use capitalisation on the ID collum.
-------------------
Folder structure
For folder and file names no capitalisation.
CSS has its own folder same goes for images/includes/database/pages.
All files and folder names should be in english.
Every page has its own CSS stylesheet. (apart from the menu.inc.css)
If folder or file names include spaces then use a underscore.
